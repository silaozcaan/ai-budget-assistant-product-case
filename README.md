# AI Budget Assistant – Product Case Study

## Overview
AI Budget Assistant is a personal finance mobile app designed to help users
understand where their money goes, automatically categorize expenses,
and build simple budgeting habits with AI-powered insights.

This project is an end-to-end **product case study**, focusing on
product thinking, user experience, MVP definition, and success metrics
rather than software development.

## Problem
Many young users struggle to manage their personal finances due to
low financial visibility, irregular income, and the complexity of
existing budgeting tools.

Even users with stable income often cannot clearly answer the question:
**“Where did my money go?”**

This leads to poor budgeting habits, financial stress, and lack of savings.

- **University students** with irregular or limited income
- **First-year white-collar professionals** struggling with budgeting discipline
- **Freelancers** with unstable cash flow and changing monthly income

automatically categorizes transactions using AI, and presents financial
data through a clean and simple interface.
